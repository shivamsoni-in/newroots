                        <p>
                            Male pattern baldness treatment always needs DHT blockers like finasteride or dutasteride. 
                            According to the study, one in every six men aged 18 to 29 is affected by moderate to extensive 
                            hair loss, and by age 40 to 49, half of all men are affected. The typical dosage of finasteride 
                            for hair loss is 1 mg per day. But the dose changes depending upon age, grade of baldness, 
                            amount of hair fall, and post-hair transplant surgery.
                        </p>

                                Research shows that a 1 mg tablet per day is generally the most effective dosage of finasteride 
                                for treating and preventing hair loss. For full benefits, one needs to take a dosage of 1 mg per day.

                        <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-2"> How Does Finasteride Work For Hair Loss ? - </h2>
                        <p>
                            Hair loss from male pattern baldness occurs as a result of your genetics and exposure to DHT hormones. 
                            DHT is a byproduct of testosterone. DHT can attack your hair follicles through those having receptors 
                            linked to genetic linked genes, causing them to stop producing new hair.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finasteride works by inhibiting an enzyme called 5α-reductase — an enzyme that’s responsible for 
                            converting testosterone into DHT. By doing this, finasteride causes DHT levels in your body to 
                            decrease, allowing your hair to avoid DHT-related damage.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finasteride can reduce DHT levels in your body by up to 70%.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example, a large-scale study carried out in Japan looked at the effects of finasteride over 10 
                            years in men with male pattern baldness. More than 530 men used finasteride daily at a typical 
                            dosage of 1 mg, with their progress recorded via scalp photographs and a questionnaire.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Over the course of 10 years, 99.1 percent of the men that took part in the study experienced the 
                            prevention of male pattern baldness progression. Put simply, their hair loss stopped after they 
                            started using finasteride, with no worsening over a 10-year period.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            91.55 percent of the men in the study experienced a slight, moderate or significant improvement 
                            in their hair growth over the course of the 10-year study period.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In other words, despite being genetically prone to male pattern baldness, almost all of the men 
                            that took part in the study saw their hair either stop falling out or grow back after they started 
                            to use finasteride at a 1 mg daily dosage.
                        </p>






                        
                        <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-2"> Using Finasteride At A Lower Dosage - </h2>
                        <p>
                            Although they’re uncommon, finasteride can cause side effects. If you experience side effects at a 1 mg 
                            per day dosage, reducing your dosage of finasteride could make them less noticeable, or even cause them 
                            to disappear entirely. To avoid these side effects, one should exercise caution, especially if they are 
                            taking tablets for an extended period of time. Start with a 1 mg dose and gradually reduce to 0.5 mg 
                            per day after 6 months, when hair loss has stabilized, to maintain plasma levels of finasteride in the 
                            blood and adjust dosage as needed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Research shows that finasteride still works relatively well as a male pattern baldness treatment at 
                            dosages below the 1 mg per day level.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology looked at the effects 
                            of finasteride on DHT at dosages of 0.01, 0.05, 0.2, and 1 mg per day over 42 days of treatment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although the study didn’t specifically measure hair loss, the researchers found that DHT levels in the 
                            skin of the scalp decreased by the following levels :
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As you can see, even the relatively low dosages of finasteride (0.05 mg per 
                            day and 0.2 mg per day) caused a noticeable reduction in DHT levels.
                        </p>

                      <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-2"> Dosage Of Finasteride For Hair Transplant Patients- </h2>
                      <p>
                        Even after a transplant, DHT levels in the scalp are prevalent and may cause further 
                        damage to even transplanted hair. Depending upon the grade of baldness, we design the 
                        dosage of finasteride so that the result of hair transplant doesn’t deteriorate. We 
                        initially advise starting a dosage of finasteride of 1 mg before the hair transplant 
                        to stabilise hair loss and then plan for the hair transplant. Patients usually take 
                        finasteride for 6 months to a year, which then leads to thinning of implanted hairs 
                        and even existing hairs. So, patients should not discontinue medicines even after 1 
                        year of their transplant, and we advise continuing at a dosage of 0.5 mg per day so 
                        that it maintains the result of transplanted hair.
                      </p>
