                                                    Hair transplant surgery is a permanent solution for hair loss, as the transplanted hair follicles are taken from the back of the scalp, where hair growth is permanent.

                            Taking medications after hair transplant surgery is essential to ensure proper healing and prevent complications.

                        <p>
                            Patients should follow the instructions of their surgeon regarding the dosage and frequency of medications.
