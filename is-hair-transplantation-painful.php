                            <a href="hair-transplant.php" target="_blank">Hair transplant surgery</a> is typically performed in a doctor's office or clinic under local anesthesia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before the procedure, your scalp will be cleaned and prepared.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The surgeon will then use a special tool to remove individual hair follicles from the donor area of your scalp.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These follicles will then be transplanted into the balding or thinning areas of your scalp.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The duration of the procedure will depend on the number of follicles being transplanted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Smaller procedures may only take a few hours, while larger procedures may take several hours or even multiple sessions.

                        <p>
                            Hair transplant surgery can be an effective way to restore a fuller head of hair, and the procedure is generally not as painful as many people expect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While you may experience some discomfort during and after the procedure, this can usually be managed with pain medication and other measures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With proper care and follow-up, most people who undergo hair transplant surgery experience no major problems or complications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are considering a hair transplant, it's important to discuss the procedure in detail with your doctor or surgeon and to carefully consider the risks and benefits.
