                        <p>
                            Before undergoing a hair transplant surgery, you will need to meet with a <a href="our-team.php" target="_blank">hair transplant specialist</a> to determine if you are a good candidate for the procedure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You may be asked to stop taking certain medications or supplements that can thin the blood, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, in the weeks leading up to the surgery.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You will also need to avoid smoking and drinking alcohol before and after the surgery, as they can slow down the healing process.

                        <p>
                            The duration of a hair transplant surgery can vary significantly, depending on several factors :
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Number of Grafts : </h3>
                        <p>
                            One of the significant factors that can affect the duration of a hair transplant surgery is the number of grafts required.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A graft is a cluster of hair follicles that are transplanted as a unit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The higher the number of grafts needed, the longer it will take to complete the procedure.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Technique Used : </h3>
                        <p>
                            There are two primary techniques used in hair transplant surgery: Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            FUE is a more time-consuming process than FUT, which can affect the duration of the procedure.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Experience of the Surgeon : </h3>
                        <p>
                            The experience of the surgeon can also impact the duration of the surgery.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An experienced surgeon will be able to perform the procedure more efficiently, reducing the duration of the surgery.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Type of Anaesthesia Used : </h3>
                        <p>
                            The type of anaesthesia used can also impact the duration of the surgery.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Local anaesthesia is often used for hair transplant surgery, which can take a shorter time to wear off compared to general anaesthesia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On average, a hair transplant surgery can take anywhere from 4 to 8 hours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, in some cases, it may take up to 12 hours to complete the procedure.

                            Hair transplant surgery involves several steps:
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Donor Hair Removal : </h3>
                        <p>
                            The first step in a hair transplant surgery involves the removal of donor hair.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The donor hair is typically taken from the back or sides of the scalp, where hair growth is thicker and more robust.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Follicle Extraction : </h3>
                        <p>
                            Once the donor hair is removed, the surgeon will extract hair follicles from the donor hair.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This process can be done using either FUT or FUE techniques.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Graft Preparation : </h3>
                        <p>
                            After the hair follicles are extracted, the surgeon will prepare the grafts for transplantation.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Graft Transplantation : </h3>
                        <p>
                            The final step in a hair transplant surgery involves the transplantation of the grafts into the recipient site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The surgeon will carefully place each graft into the balding or thinning area of the scalp.

                        <p>
                            FUE surgery generally has a faster recovery time than FUT surgery.

                        <p>
                            The size of the transplanted area can also impact the recovery time. The larger the area, the longer it may take to heal.

                        <p>
                            The recovery time can also vary from person to person, as someindividuals may heal faster than others.

                            In general, it is recommended to take at least a week off work after the surgery to allow the scalp to heal. The transplanted hair may fall out after a few weeks, which is normal, and new hair growth should start within a few months.

                            It is crucial to follow the post-operative care instructions provided by the surgeon to ensure proper healing and the best possible results.

                            Hair transplant surgery is an effective solution for those experiencing hair loss, but it is important to consider the duration of the surgery, the recovery time, and other factors before deciding to undergo the procedure.
