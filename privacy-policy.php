                transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved.
                Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards
                Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
                PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its
                service providers.
