                        <p>
                            A balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals such as iron, protein, and vitamins A and C can help support healthy hair growth.

                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Avoid heat styling : </h3>
                        <p>
                            Overuse of heat-styling tools like flat irons and curling wands can damage hair follicles and lead to hair loss. If heat styling is necessary, use a heat protector and keep the temperature on a low setting.
                        </p>

                            Styles like tight braids, cornrows, and ponytails can pull hair follicles and lead to hair loss.
