                    <p>Beard has always been essential to men. In the past decade, with the rising
                        importance of social media, pictures of bushy men with beards have become the definition of
                        masculinity and pleasing look. Many of them are not lucky enough to have full and thick beard so
                        they put on many solutions on face but the fact is that if one doesn’t have Follicles underneath
                        your skin no use of solutions whichever you apply. <a href="hair-transplant.php">Hair transplant</a> in beard can be the permanent
                        solution for your fuller and thicker beard, in order to improve the volume, define and enhance
                        facial appearance when there is uneven hair growth.</p>


                     <h2 class="subtitle approach  mt-5">Candidates who can do beard transplant-</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ideally beard hair transplant should be done after age 27 as there are chances of beard growth
                        till age 27. The candidates seeking beard hair transplant should not have problems like
                        androgenic alopecia or scalp hair solutions. As this is cosmetic procedure if patient goes in
                        male pattern baldness then patient have need of possibility of hair transplant in scalp. If
                        grade 2-4 baldness and having good and enough donor with stabilized hair fall problems then can
                        go for both hair transplant on both beard and scalp.
                    </p>

                    <p>If any patient having damaged beard due to scar due to burns, accident, any
                        surgeries also can undergo hair transplant in beard and moustache.</p>

                  <h2 class="subtitle approach  mt-5">Process of Beard Hair Transplant</h2>
                    <p>Process is same as FUE hair transplant but the major change is that selection of
                        grafts is very important factor to give good result. Next, after assessing the number of grafts
                        required the design of the beard and moustache is made according to the preferences and needs of
                        the patient. It is crucially important to match with the facial structure.
                    </p>
                      <p>The grafts selected should be single hair and thick strand. 
                      The harvested grafts are then prepared for implantation. In process of implantation there are 2 techniques
                      – one is DHI & other is slit technique / taking incisions. In the DHI - <a href="dhi-hair-transplant.php">Direct Hair Implantation</a>, 
                      with help of instrument choi implanter, the follicles are placed one by one directly into the thinning areas of beard,
                      without the need to open micro-channels so as with the FUE method.  Both techniques give almost same results according 
                      to the comfort of surgeon. But he should make ensure that the angles and direction of implantation are very much alike
                      like other existing grafts otherwise it gives a bad look and which is very difficult to repair your beard hair transplant. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Recovery of beard hair transplant takes almost 5-7 days. Scabs start to shed
                        after 4-5 days.

                      <h2 class="subtitle approach  mt-5"> Precautions after beard hair transplant – </h2>
                    <p>There is little numbness in facial skin for 4-5 days but it recovers within no
                        time. There need to be used some special facial wash ingredients to use before and after surgery
                        to avoid infections.
