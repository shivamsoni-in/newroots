                        Day by day, hair transplant surgeries are becoming safer, more effective, and yielding more

                        It totally depends upon how well you follow the aftercare routine. Post-surgery, all precautions 
                        are to be taken to ensure the new grafts are not damaged. During sleep, extra care is to be 
                        taken in the initial 7 days, even if it is a <a href="fue-hair-transplant.php">FUE hair transplant</a>.

                        During post-surgery care, 
                        most patients share a common concern about how to sleep after a transplant so that grafts 
                        are not dislodged or the donor area is not problematic.

                                Sleep with your head and back slightly elevated, at least 45 degrees, on a soft pillow. 
                                Sleeping in an elevated position will help to reduce swelling in your scalp and help you recover faster.

                                Tossing and turning are prohibited as they may damage or dislodge grafts.

                                To avoid infection, bedsheets, pillowcases, and the bed itself should be clean. 
                                Also, use a soft towel or drape sheets above the pillow to avoid stains.

                                A neck or travel pillow helps you only during travel or till you get 
                                home after surgery. Put a cushion or another pillow under your pillow 
                                to keep your head correctly elevated and avoid damaging your hair follicles.

                        Within 7–14 days, you can start sleeping, usually as before one has developed a habit. 
                        So, after the first head wash, one can sleep normally after a hair transplant. The 
                        position of your sleep is very important because your scalp is sensitive and hair 
                        grafts are delicate. After this 7–10 day period, you should be able to normally sleep 
                        again and return to normal physical activities.
