                        Hello friends, Welcome to the <a href="index.php">best hair transplant clinic in India</a>. Many of us get confused regarding the maximum age for 
                        hair transplant, like can I get a <a href="hair-transplant.php">hair transplant</a> at 65, does age matter in hair transplant, is 30 a 
                        good age for hair transplant, etc.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        The fact is that excellent results are common at age 50 and older who decide to have hair 
                        transplantation late in life. Men are seldom too old to consider hair transplantation as a 
                        treatment for hair loss as a treatment. Male pattern hair loss can be triggered at any age, 
                        from adolescence to their 40s. Some people choose early treatments to maintain their cosmetic 
                        appearance, while others let their hair grow and seek treatment when it stabilizes. And some 
                        consider it a fact and seek no treatment.
                    </p>

                    <P>
                        Many elderly patients are worried that they will not achieve results at their age. The answer is that 
                        they will achieve good results and their results will last a long time because of the fact that their 
                        hair loss progression is stabilised at the age of 40s in many age groups. Our hair transplant specialists 
                        at New Roots Hair Clinic are ready to alleviate your concerns by maintaining accountability for the 
                        risks involved and providing an honest opinion regarding the procedures in your hair transplant.
                    </P>
