                    <p >Even though the hair transplant procedure is minimal invasive still it requires
                        anaesthesia. many of them fear for hair transplant procedure till the surgery is started. The
                        time when surgery starts the fear is gone because he has given local anaesthesia and feels no any
                        pain. Many patients avoid surgery plans due to fear of pain. This article will give full
                        knowledge regarding what is pain free or needle free anaesthesia.</p>
                   

                   <p>Painless or pain free anaesthesia means the
                        comfort of level patient is getting during his surgery. There are various routes through which
                        patients has no any pain during his surgery which are as follows:</p>
                    
                     <ul class="px-0">
                        <li class="text-bold"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i><span class="title_li">General anaesthesia</span>
                        <p class="p-0 pl-5"> In this type patient is given sedation so that during giving local
                                anaesthesia he doesn’t feel any discomfort. No deep sedation is required</p></li>
                                
                        <li class="text-bold"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i><span class="title_li">Local anaesthesia</span>
                         <p class="p-0 pl-5">Local anaesthesia is the most widely used type of anaesthesia in hair
                                transplant procedures. Local anaesthesia can be administered by smallest diameter insulin
                                syringe.</p>
                        </li>
                         
                    </ul>
                     

                    <p >In hair transplantation, during the process of donor harvesting and recipient
                        site creation, local anaesthesia is required. This local anaesthesia in its simplest form is
                        administered via needle injection. To describe the pain felt in local anaesthesia injection; it
                        is similar to the pain experienced in dental procedures.</p>
                    <p >During injecting needles the drug is delivered slowly so that the skin
                        irritation is reduced to minimal and patient doesn’t feel any pain. When the drug is injected in
                        a particular place from the same anesthetized area the next injection is delivered so that no
                        any pain sensation is felt. We select particular nerve areas so that we could block areas where
                        it covers major skin area and hence then the more skin area is covered with only few injections.
                    </p>
                    <p >Today, the most advanced method to reduce pain is to give sedation before
                        applying local anesthetics.
                        Sedation differs from general anaesthesia. General anaesthesia is used to put the patient into a
                        deep sleep and makes the patient fully unconscious. On the other hand, the patient under
                        sedation will be awake but will feel relaxed and at ease.
