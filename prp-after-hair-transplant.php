                            <a href="prp.php">PRP</a> stands for platelet-rich plasma. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is concentrated blood plasma 
                            that contains approximately 3 to 5 times the number of platelets found in normal circulating blood.

                        <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-2"> What is PRP ? </h2>
                        <p>
                            It is concentrated blood plasma obtained after centrifuging of the blood of a patient freshly 
                            withdrawn  which contains leukocytes, growth factors, platelets, and cytokines. It has been 
                            observed to help in hair loss prevention, wound healing, and soft tissue healing.

                        <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-2"> Why is PRP recommended after a hair transplant ? </h2>
                        <p>
                            PRP treatment uses the patient's own blood to enrich the plasma . The substances present 
                            in plasma derived from PRP help in faster tissue growth, which helps in the recovery of 
                            hair transplants. There is minute surgical damage caused to the scalp due to slits or 
                            implantation . All of this is recovered much faster than usual with the help of PRP. It 
                            nourishes the hair follicles with the help of growth factors. As hair follicles are 
                            taken from the donor and implanted in the recipient area, it goes into a resting phase 
                            due to the break down of blood supply . It needs extra support from growth factors in this phase.

                        <p>
                            During the harvesting of the hair follicles from the donor area of the scalp and implantation 
                            into the recipient area, the follicles have a chance to be damaged in many ways.

                        <p>
                            Dehydration may occur if the donor follicle is not properly kept in hydration liquid 
                            between collection and transplantation. starvation of oxygen and nutrients due to 
                            withdrawal of blood from the blood supply during the period from collection to transplant. 
                            temperature and acid/base changes in the follicular environment.

                            <p>
                                Many surgeons use PRP treatment during hair transplant surgery to store grafts to maintain the 
                                viability of grafts and also inject them into wounds to heal faster. It improves healing, 
                                minimises scarring and promotes maximum hair growth in the transplanted follicles.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-2 pb-3"> When should PRP be started ? </h2>
                            <p>
                                With PRP, growth factors and platelets come into the scalp. This has a positive effect on 
                                the whole healing process. However, for the PRP treatment to be successful, it is extremely 
                                important to do it at the right time. The PRP treatment can be performed 10 days after a 
                                hair transplant without any problems. Further sessions should be scheduled for 1 month, 
                                3 months, and 6 months later. A total of four treatment sessions is usually sufficient.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                PRP is a good option to increase the success rate of hair transplantation. However, never 
                                forget that the procedures of the clinic where you have the hair transplant should be adapted to 
                                it. Treatment of post-surgical complications is more important than how the procedure is performed.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If anyone is unable to take PRP after a hair transplant, they will not only get the result, but 
                                they will also lose the benefits of PRP, which aid in hair growth.
                            </p>

                            <p>
