                      <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-2"> INTRODUCTION : </h2>
                      <p>
                        Hair transplant procedures are life-changing for many people. To maintain the result, many 
                        patients ask if it is necessary to take finasteride after the operation and, if so, until when. 
                        The answer is yes!
                      </p>
                     
                        <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-2"> Why is Finasteride Compulsory After Hair Transplant ? </h2>
                        <p>
                            Male pattern baldness generally persists overtime and makes a person lose their hair over a 
                            long period of time. Then one solution for male pattern baldness is finasteride. Until you 
                            continue, 91% of patients will not lose their hair; if you stop using finasteride, hair starts 
                            to fall out again. Male pattern baldness cannot be cured, however a hair transplant can cover 
                            your bald patches by replacing them with hair from the donor area.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finasteride prevents hair loss from the transplanted area as well as existing hair that is not 
                            transplanted. If finasteride is not taken after transplants, it can lead to an undesired look 
                            as male pattern baldness progresses. Taking finasteride after a hair transplant can prevent 
                            hair loss in the future and help you preserve a head full of hair that you naturally possess. 
                            Taking finasteride orally and topically is the best option to retain your transplanted and 
                            existing hair. It avoids the chance of further second hair transplants in the future.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-2"> When can I use finasteride? </h2>
                        <p>
                            As we have mentioned, finasteride should be used consistently to show its effect. This means 
                            that you will have to use finasteride as long as you want to keep your natural hair. The 
                            medication has been on the market since 1992, for more than 30 years, and studies show that 
                            it is safe to use finasteride over a long period of time. But there are some considerations 
                            like age, amount of hair fall, grade of baldness, lifestyle, etc. that decide the dosage 
                            and period of finasteride.
                        </p>
