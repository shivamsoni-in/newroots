                            Hair transplants are easily detectable if one observes a person throughout his life. In the case of Bollywood star Salman Khan, pictures taken in his movies from 2003 to 2022 show signs of hair loss. However, the most recent photos show healthier hair.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-2"> Salman Khan Hair Transplant </h2>
                        <p>
                            Hair transplants are a common cosmetic procedure to restore hair growth in areas affected by hair loss.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The procedure involves removing hair follicles from one part of the head and transplanting them to the balding area.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The transplanted hair typically continues to grow in the new location.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We can see that he was losing his hairline and was on the verge of going bald. He obviously needed to restore his hairline, so he went with hairline restoration.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-2"> First attempt: 2003 - 2004 </h2>
                        <p>
                            <a href="hair-transplant.php" target="_blank">Hair transplant surgery</a> was not as common as it is today, and it was a very rare procedure. At the time, the technique that evolved was FUT, in which you get a scar on your donor that is visible when you go bald. After that, one can see changes in his hairline, but they are not substantial. Also, one can see that the hairline work is done. After one year of hair transplantation, visible results can be seen.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-2"> Second attempt - 2007 </h2>
                        <p>
                            Here, one can see that after 2-3 years, he went again for his second hair transplant. Here we have collected his images from his films during his tenure, which may have been in 2006. He underwent hair transplant surgery a second time with the <a href="fue-hair-transplant.php" target="_blank">FUE technique</a>, which didn’t leave any scars in his donor, and his recovery was faster this time. In his second attempt, he corrected his first surgery and got a good hairline. He has reimplanted in the same area, increasing the thickness and darkness of the hairline.
                        </p>

                            Now again, one can see good results after 2008 in his movies, again flaunting a short and natural hairline.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The hairline remains the same, but it is more prominent now.

                            Let me clear up some <a href="common-myths-and-misconceptions-about-hair-transplant.php" target="_blank">myths and misconceptions about hair transplants</a> for all of us.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The following points should be kept in mind while undergoing hair transplant surgery.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            More than 95% of patients who undergo hair transplantation have androgenic alopecia, which is progressive in nature. It clearly indicates that your existing hair is at risk of falling out in the future.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Only MINOXIDIL and <a href="maximum-daily-dosage-of-finasteride.php" target="_blank">FINASTERIDE</a> are options available till date for controlling androgenic alopecia, and if they are discontinued, the baldness keeps increasing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Naturally, Salman Khan was suffering from progressive baldness, with DHT hormones attacking his grafts. To maintain a good look with natural hair as an actor in Bollywood on the big screen, one should have good hair. There are also many options where Himesh Reshammiya, Amitabh Bachchan, and Kapil Sharma use hair wigs but they never suit everyone and not everyone is comfortable with them.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            As seen in his films, his condition worsened after 10 years of a second hair transplant as his baldness progressed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            According to reports, he had his 3rd <a href="fue-hair-transplant.php" target="_blank">FUE hair transplant</a> in Panvel at his farm house, where he received a denser look than the previous one. One can see him in recent movies with better hair than before his surgeries. He has used his beard, as well as a donor's scalp, to extract more grafts. Redness is still noticeable in the beard cheek portion and scalp donor. He had a refill implantation in his vertex area to conceal scalp visibility and give him a more dense appearance. I hope he is happy with his denser hair again.
                        </p>

                            Perhaps Salman Khan now has to work on a daily basis to maintain his hair. You should not stop taking care of your hair if you have had a hair transplant.

                        <p>
                            Similarly, Salman Khan also has to take care of his hair, or else he might face the same problem again.

                        <p>
                            A hair transplant doctor should be <a href="contact.php" target="_blank">consulted</a> even after many years to keep both transplanted and existing hair in good condition.
