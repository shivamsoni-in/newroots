                        <p>
                            A hair transplant is a cosmetic procedure that involves transplanting hair follicles from one part of the body to another. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The most common area for hair transplantation is the scalp, where it is used to treat male and female pattern baldness.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The process involves taking hair follicles from a donor area, typically the back or sides of the head, and transplanting them into the recipient area, which is usually the top of the head or the hairline.

                            Actor Mukesh Bhat always used to get young lead roles, but because of his grade 7 hair loss, he was not getting young lead roles. So, it was very necessary to give him back his natural look.

                            Hair transplant surgery is typically performed under local anesthesia, which means that the patient will not feel any pain during the procedure.
