                            Following <b>pre-op instructions</b> laid down by your surgeon is extremely critical.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please adhere to all instructions strictly, since failure to do so can have adverse effects on the hair transplant surgery and can cause post-procedure complications.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Once youâ€™ve decided on having a hair transplant, your doctor will ask you to undergo a routine of tests: CBC, HCV, bleeding time, clotting time, PT, HBsAG, blood sugar, ELISA, and ECG.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            These are mandatory to ensure that you do not have any underlying medical issues that may complicate the surgery.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            In case you do have certain medical conditions, then it is vital to confirm whether everything is within range.

                            Five days before <a href="hair-transplant.php" target="_blank">hair transplant surgery</a>, you need to act in accordance with the instructions given by your surgeon.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Consultation with the Surgeon : </h3>
                        <p>
                            Before undergoing the hair transplant procedure, it is important to have a <a href="our-team.php" target="_blank">consultation with the surgeon</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the consultation, the surgeon will evaluate your hair loss condition, examine your scalp, and determine your candidature for the procedure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They will also discuss the procedure, its risks and benefits, and answer any questions you may have.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Medical History and Medication : </h3>
                        <p>
                            It is important to inform your surgeon about your medical history and any medication you are taking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some medications can interfere with the hair transplant procedure and cause complications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your surgeon will provide instructions on what medications to avoid or adjust before the procedure.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Avoid Blood Thinning Medication : </h3>
                        <p>
                            It is important to avoid blood thinning medication such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen before the hair transplant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These medications can increase the risk of bleeding during the procedure.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Smoking and Alcohol Consumption : </h3>
                        <p>
                            It is advisable to quit smoking and avoid alcohol consumption at least two weeks before the hair transplant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Smoking and alcohol can affect the healing process and increase the risk of complications.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Avoid using hair styling products such as gel, hairspray, and hair wax a day before the hair transplant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These products can interfere with the procedure and affect the outcome.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2"> Shampooing and Haircut : </h3>
                        <p>
                            It is recommended to shampoo your hair on the day of the procedure before coming to the clinic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Avoid getting a haircut as the surgeon may need to shave the donor and recipient areas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In case you find it difficult to follow the guidelines set down for you, then you must let your surgeon know before the surgery.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, if your health care provider alters your existing medicines or changes their dosage, you absolutely must notify your surgeon.

                            One day prior to the surgery, you will be asked to follow these guidelines:

                                Get good sleep, the night before your surgery. You need to be well rested and anxiety-free.
                            </li>

                                If you are traveling from out of town to get to the clinic, make sure you arrive one day prior, so that you can settle in comfortably and be stress free before the procedure. Do not travel immediately before or after the procedure.
                            </li>

                                When you come for the procedure, wear a buttoned-down shirt, not a T-shirt. Wear anything that feels comfortable, avoid wearing clothes that need to be pulled over your head to remove them. Pulling a T-shirt over the head will cause the newly transplanted grafts to become dislodged or damaged.
                            </li>

                                Wash your scalp well on the day of the surgery. It is crucial that the donor site be squeaky clean and completely free from dirt, dandruff, and seborrhea. If the scalp isn't clean, the surgery will almost certainly be postponed.
                            </li>
