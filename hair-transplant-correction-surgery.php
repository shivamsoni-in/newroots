                    <p>Many patients initially get fail to choose the right clinic and later they regret
                        after 6 months that what mistake they have done. Not only money but also they loose precious
                        donor area permanently. </p>

                    <p>Inspite of developed instrumentations & technologies the number of correction
                        operations is
                        increasing every year. Many of patients are not happy after their transplant and they blame that
                        <a href="hair-transplant.php">hair transplant</a> is not successful. but the fact is that patient selection or doctor selection is
                        very much important aspect in each one’s part.

                     <h2 class="subtitle approach wow bounceInUp mt-5"> Reasons for Failure in Hair Transplantation</h2>
                    <ul class="">
                        <li class="text-bold mt-2 hair_surgery">  One of the main reasons of
                            unsuccessful transplant is that patients who are not suitable for hair transplantation
                            although their donor condition is not good enough, the patients are given words for
                            satisfactory results.
                        </li>
                        <li class="text-bold mt-2 hair_surgery">  It is necessary to make sure that the
                            surgeon and the patient fully understand each other during the planning phase because these
                            procedures are aesthetic procedures where most of the times we don’t get our desired area
                            coverage, density, hairline depending upon donor availability. Most the times surgery is
                            done as per only patient’s expectations and not keeping in mind the later aesthetic
                            appearance.
                        </li>
                        <li class="text-bold mt-2 hair_surgery"> The lack of appearance of natural
                            hairline due to wrong design, wrong placements of grafts in depth, direction or angle.
                            Lethargy in selection of thin or soft or single grafts for hairline gives brush or grass
                            like appearance of hairline.
                        </li>
                        <li class="text-bold mt-2 hair_surgery">  Incomplete density of grafts due to
                            damage to the hair follicles due to an improper extraction, not keeping grafts in suitable
                            solutions or cold environment. </li>
                        <li class="text-bold mt-2 hair_surgery">  long duration of the procedure,
                            improper handling of grafts during the transplantation process leads to decreased life of
                            hair transplant. </li>
                        <li class="text-bold mt-2 hair_surgery">  The care of the patient during the
                            recovery period is very important as well like during travelling, sleeping, head wash he
                            should be careful and even instructed till he knows thorough. </li>
                        <li class="text-bold mt-2 hair_surgery" > A result with a lower density than
                            desired is also one of the reasons for a failure. The skill of surgeon is very important in
                            placing of grafts with appropriate density.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h2 class="subtitle approach wow bounceInUp mt-5">How to fix failed hair transplant?</h2>

                        <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> <span class="title_li">Too lowered hairline - </span><p
                                class="p-0 about_p mt-0"> After assessing the donor area of failed hair transplant patient and
                                the places of correction in patient whatever it may be like hairline, wrong temple
                                creation, wrong angle of grafts, less density, etc. we plan with patient what he has
                                mistaken previously and what things we are going to give him satisfactory results. If
                                the hairline is too much lowered we still extract the grafts with smallest diameter
                                punches to avoid the scar and again utilize the grafts where actually required. </p>
                        </li>

                                Thorn like temples are also again extracted and we select the very soft hair from just
                                the nape of neck which resembles to temple hair. We implant it with not only correct
                                selection of grafts but also placement in proper angulation and direction of grafts.
                            </p>

                                When a patient needs to regain again the desired density the procedure is to place
                                grafts in previous area of transplant again without damaging previous grafts and check
                                whether the grafts are placed exactly in proper depth because the skin is not like
                                previous one, as it is fibrosed due to previous incisions.
                            </p>

                                Many times not all hairs grow from each graft and if some hair grown they grow very thin
                                giving weird appearance. again, refilling is done to make look the scalp thicker.
                            </p>
