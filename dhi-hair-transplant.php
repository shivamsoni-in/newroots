                    <p >It is a technique and part of a process of hair transplantation which has become
                        popular in last decade. DHI technique is similar to the <a href="fue-hair-transplant.php">FUE hair transplant</a> technique, but
                        differs in its application technique. The DHI hair transplant is also known as the technique of
                        direct hair transplantation and the pen technique. The choi implanter guides the graft directly
                        to the scalp. </p>
                    <p >DHI technique is not only well known to achieve the most natural-looking results
                        but also it provides maximum life for transplanted hair than any other technique. The use of the
                        Choi pen makes it possible to implant hair in more density.</p>

                    <p>  
                        <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-5">Process DHI Hair Transplant</h2>
                        The process is same till extraction of
                        grafts. After extraction of grafts instead of making slits or incisions the grafts are loaded in
                        implanters and they are directly implanted to scalp. 
                    </p>

                    <p>There are different sizes of choi implanter needles according to the sizes of
                        needle of choi implanters. The smallest size is for single hair follicle, bigger than this is
                        for double hair follicle, successively for triple and quadruple hair follicles. Depending upon
                        the graft’s arrangements the choi implanters are used. After local anesthesia in recipient site
                        the implanters are loaded with help of technicians and surgeon implants in scalp with help of
                        pen or choi implanters one by one. After the sharpness is reduced of pen those are replaced with
                        new one. Choi implanter enables implanting hair grafts at accurate angles, direction and depth
                        without damaging surrounding tissues. 
                    </p>

                     <h2 class="subtitle approach   mt-5">Advantages of DHI Technique</h2>
                    <p >Greatest advantages of DHI over classic FUE emerges to be the lack of
                        need to make slits i.e., making incisions to create hair transplant channels where grafts are
                        inserted in the skin in the recipient area. This minimizes the trauma and bleeding and makes
                        surgery complete faster.</p>

                   <h2 class="subtitle approach   mt-5">Candidates for DHI technique</h2>
                    <ul class="">

                        <li class="DHI"> <span class="title_li">Female candidates:</span> <p class=" p-0">
                                In female candidates when they are posted for hair transplantation the major problem is
                                to shave existing hair. Here DHI is choice of technique as with help of choi implanters
                                one can implant grafts without damaging existing grafts.mThus With the DHI hair
                                transplant method, female hair transplants / long hair transplants are performed by
                                shaving only a small part that can be hidden for grafts harvesting from donor area.</p>

                        <li class="DHI"> <span class="title_li">Male candidates:</span><p class="p-0">
                                Candidates seeking for dense hair transplantation DHI is the good choice. The clients
                                having good donor area can definitely go for hair DHI hair transplant with grade 2 to
                                grade 5. This technique gives not only denser look but also gives natural look with
                                maximum life of hair transplant. In classical FUE the density we provide is not
                                satisfactory for hairline patients, definitely one gets better results with highest
                                density in DHI. </p>
