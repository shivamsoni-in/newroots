                            The derma roller is a root and hair follicle stimulator.

                        <img src="assets/img/blog/how-does-derma-roller-help-with-hair-growth.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="how does derma roller help with hair growth">
                        <br><br>
                        
                        <p>
                            Using a derma roller on the scalp can promote hair growth in several ways.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First, the punctures created by the needles on the scalp stimulate blood circulation and increase the flow of nutrients to the hair follicles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This increased blood flow provides the hair follicles with the necessary nutrients to promote hair growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Second, the punctures created by the needles also stimulate the production of collagen and elastin in the scalp.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Collagen and elastin are essential for healthy skin and hair growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The production of these proteins helps to strengthen the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Third, using a derma roller can help increase the absorption of topical hair growth products.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The punctures created by the needles on the scalp create channels that allow hair growth products to penetrate deeper into the scalp, increasing their effectiveness.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Using a <b>derma roller for hair growth</b> has several benefits, including :
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Reduces Hair Loss </h3>
                        <p>
                            Using a derma roller on the scalp can also reduce hair loss.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The increased blood flow to the hair follicles and the production of collagen and elastin help to strengthen the hair follicles, reducing hair loss.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Safe and Non-Invasive </h3>
                        <p>
                            Using derma roller for hair growth is a safe and non-invasive treatment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The tiny needles on the derma roller penetrate only the surface of the scalp and do not cause any pain or discomfort.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Better Absorption of Hair Care Products </h3>
                        <p>
                            When the microneedle penetrates the scalp, hair products get delivered right into the dermal layer of the skin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a result, using hair loss products, such as <a href="https://hairfallexperts.com/product/minoxidil_plus" target="_blank">Minoxidil</a>, <a href="prp.php" target="_blank">platelet-rich plasma</a>, and topical steroids when derma rolling is a good idea.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Massages the scalp </h3>
                        <p>
                            The derma roller increases the flow of blood to the scalp, thus encouraging good hair growth and augmenting hair thickness substantially.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Microneedling is a powerful catalyst that enhances the body’s capacity to regenerate and rebuild collagen and elastin, which in turn enhances hair growth.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Boosts Oxygen to the Roots </h3>
                        <p>
                            The derma roller for hair regrowth increases blood circulation and oxygen which helps nourish the roots.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This assures you thicker, stronger, and more beautiful hair.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Slows down the catagen phase </h3>
                        <p>
                            The <b>derma roller for hair growth</b> will delay and decelerate the shedding of hair in the catagen phase.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Cost-effective</h3>
                        <p>
                            Using a derma roller for hair growth is a <b>cost-effective</b> alternative to expensive hair growth treatments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A derma roller is a one-time purchase, and it can be used for several months before needing to be replaced.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subtitle approach mt-2">Improves Hair Texture </h3>
                        <p>
                            Using a derma roller on the scalp can also improve hair texture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The production of collagen and elastin helps to strengthen the hair follicles, resulting in thicker and stronger hair.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="subtitle approach mt-2" style="font-size:28px;">How Does the Derma Roller Work ? </h2>
                        
                        <img src="assets/img/blog/derma-roller-for-hair.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="derma roller for hair">
                        <br><br>
                        
                        <p>
                            A derma roller works by creating tiny micro-injuries to the skin, which stimulate the body's natural healing response.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When used on the scalp, the derma roller for hair creates micro-injuries to the hair follicles, which trigger the release of growth factors and stimulate the production of new hair cells.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The derma roller is typically rolled back and forth over the scalp in different directions, creating a grid-like pattern of tiny puncture wounds.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The needles on the derma roller are typically between 0.2 mm and 1.5 mm in length, depending on the desired level of penetration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The micro-injuries created by the derma roller are generally painless and do not cause any bleeding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to stimulating hair growth, the derma roller can also help to improve the overall health and appearance of the scalp and hair.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By increasing blood flow to the scalp, the derma roller can help nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It can also help reduce scalp inflammation and improve the texture and thickness of the hair.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, the derma roller is a safe and <a href="how-to-keep-hair-healthy-and-strong.php" target="_blank">effective way to promote hair growth</a> and improve the health of the scalp and hair.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Most of the <a href="index.php" target="_blank">trichology clinics in India</a> offer derma roller treatments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Getting the procedure done at a clinic yields better results compared to doing it yourself at home.

                        <p>
                            You could also do the first few treatments in a clinic and then follow them up at home. <a href="https://www.newrootshairtransplant.com/India/contact.php" target="_blank">Consult with your trichologist</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Initially, use dermarolling only once a week and observe your body’s response to it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you do not have any symptoms, you can derma roll twice a week. Never exceed 2 days per week.
