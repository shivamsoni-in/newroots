                            Male pattern baldness, also known as <a href="can-hair-transplant-be-done-on-alopecia-areata.php" target="_blank">androgenetic alopecia</a>, is a common condition that is passed down through families. Men who have a family history of male pattern baldness are more likely to develop this condition. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The male hormone testosterone is converted into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body, which can shrink hair follicles, leading to hair loss. Men who have high levels of DHT in their bodies may be more susceptible to hair loss.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Stress can cause the hair growth cycle to slow down, leading to hair loss.

                        <p>
                            The chemicals in cigarette smoke can damage hair follicles, leading to hair loss.

                            Alcohol can cause inflammation in the body, which can lead to hair loss.

                            hairstyles that pull at the hair, such as cornrows, braids, and tight ponytails, can cause hair loss.
                        </p>

                            It's important to remember that some hair loss is a normal part of the hair growth cycle; it's only when the hair fall is excessive and not being replaced by new hair growth that it becomes a problem.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            <b>Medications :</b> Finasteride (Propecia) and minoxidil (Rogaine) are two FDA-approved medications that can help slow down hair loss and promote hair growth.

                            <b>Hair transplantation :</b> <a href="hair-transplant-clinic-mumbai.php" target="_blank">Hair transplant in Mumbai</a> is a surgical procedure that involves removing hair from a denser area of the scalp (the donor site) and transplanting it to a thinner area (the recipient site).

                            The most common method of <a href="hair-transplant.php" target="_blank">hair transplantation</a> is called Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) or "strip method" which involves removing a strip of hair-bearing skin from the donor site and then separating it into individual hair follicles. These follicles are then transplanted to the recipient site.

                            Another method is <a href="fue-hair-transplant.php" target="_blank">Follicular Unit Extraction</a> (FUE) which involves removing individual hair follicles from the donor site using a small punch tool and then transplanting them to the recipient site. FUE is less invasive than FUT, but it can be more time-consuming and may require multiple sessions to achieve the desired results.

                            It's important to note that while genetics is the main cause of hair fall in men, there can be other contributing factors such as hormonal changes, medical conditions, stress, poor nutrition, and lifestyle habits.
